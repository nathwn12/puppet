## [4.1.0] - 2026-10-11

### Added

- Native Rust port of the Python incumbent — no Python runtime or venv at
  runtime; single static Windows binary.
- 5-tool stdio surface over JSON-RPC 2.0 (`screenshot`, `list_windows`,
  `window`, `do`, `cursor`), reporting
  `serverInfo { name: puppet, version: 4.1.0 }`.
- DXGI desktop-capture path alongside the GDI fallback.

### Measured

- Parity against the Python incumbent: 8/8 core, 60/60 do-parity, 9/9, 18/18
  invoke resolution (measured on the author's machine).
- Head-to-head bench against a 10-server field: ranked 2/10.
